# Genovation | IoT Platform

The IoT Platform is a demo project for IoT device management.

## Installation

For the first time, please ensure the Docker daemon is running, and then run the following command:

```bash
(cd client && npm install) && (cd server && npm install) && docker-compose up --build
```

If itâ€™s not your first time, you can just run the command:
